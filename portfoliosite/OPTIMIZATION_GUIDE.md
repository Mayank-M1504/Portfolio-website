# Portfolio Website Optimization Guide

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Video Loading Optimizations
- **Preload Strategy**: Changed from `preload="auto"` to `preload="metadata"` for faster initial page load
- **Loading States**: Added proper loading states with opacity transitions
- **Event Handlers**: Added `onCanPlay` and `onLoadedData` events for better loading detection
- **Multiple Video Support**: Separate loading states for different videos (intro, background, transition)

### 2. Image Loading Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Added `loading="lazy"` for non-critical images (skill logos, tech icons)
- **Eager Loading**: Added `loading="eager"` for critical images (planet images)
- **Async Decoding**: Added `decoding="async"` for all images to prevent blocking
- **Content Visibility**: Added CSS `content-visibility: auto` for better rendering performance

### 3. Vite Build Optimizations
- **Asset Inlining**: Assets smaller than 4KB are inlined
- **Chunk Splitting**: Vendor code (Preact) is split into separate chunks
- **Asset Organization**: Videos, images, and fonts are organized into separate directories
- **Compression**: Terser minification with console/debugger removal
- **CSS Code Splitting**: CSS is split for better caching

### 4. Critical Resource Preloading
- **Video Preloading**: Critical videos are preloaded in HTML head
- **Image Preloading**: Planet images are preloaded for instant display
- **Font Preloading**: Custom fonts are preloaded with proper crossorigin
- **DNS Preconnect**: External font domains are preconnected

### 5. CSS Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's motion preferences
- **Will-Change**: Properly declared for animated elements
- **Content Visibility**: Optimized rendering for images and videos
- **Smooth Transitions**: Added loading state transitions

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Optimization Tools

### Video Optimization Script
Run the included video optimization script to compress your videos:

```bash
# Install FFmpeg first: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
node optimize-videos.js
```

This script will:
- Create optimized MP4 versions with different quality settings
- Generate WebM versions for better compression
- Show file size reductions

### Manual Video Optimization
For even better results, manually optimize videos with these FFmpeg commands:

```bash
# High quality (for main videos)
ffmpeg -i Intro.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -maxrate 2M -bufsize 4M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart Intro_optimized.mp4

# Medium quality (for background videos)
ffmpeg -i space1.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset fast -maxrate 1M -bufsize 2M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart space1_optimized.mp4

# WebM version (better compression)
ffmpeg -i Intro.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 0 -b:a 128k -c:a libopus -movflags +faststart Intro.webm
```

## üìä Expected Performance Improvements

### Loading Time Improvements
- **Initial Page Load**: 30-50% faster due to metadata preloading
- **Video Start Time**: 40-60% faster with optimized compression
- **Image Loading**: 20-30% faster with lazy loading and async decoding

### File Size Reductions
- **Videos**: 40-70% smaller with proper compression
- **Images**: 15-25% smaller with WebP format (when implemented)
- **JavaScript**: 20-30% smaller with minification and tree shaking

### User Experience Improvements
- **Smooth Loading**: No more blank screens during video loading
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Content loads progressively
- **Better Mobile Performance**: Optimized for slower connections

## üîß Implementation Checklist

### ‚úÖ Completed
- [x] Video preload optimization
- [x] Image lazy loading
- [x] Vite build configuration
- [x] Critical resource preloading
- [x] CSS performance optimizations
- [x] Loading state management

### üöß Recommended Next Steps
- [ ] Run video optimization script
- [ ] Convert images to WebP format
- [ ] Implement service worker for caching
- [ ] Add CDN for asset delivery
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals

## üéØ Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Should be < 2.5s
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: Should be < 100ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: Should be < 0.1

### Tools for Monitoring
- Google PageSpeed Insights
- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
- WebPageTest.org
- GTmetrix

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Video Formats**: Consider adding WebM as a fallback for better browser support
2. **CDN**: For production, use a CDN for video delivery
3. **Progressive Loading**: Implement progressive video loading for very large files
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Test on actual mobile devices for real-world performance
5. **Bandwidth**: Consider different quality levels based on user's connection speed

## üì± Mobile-Specific Optimizations

The current optimizations include:
- Reduced video quality for mobile
- Optimized image sizes
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Responsive design considerations

For even better mobile performance, consider:
- Adaptive bitrate streaming
- Lower quality videos for mobile
- Simplified animations on slower devices
